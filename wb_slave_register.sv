 *
 * General description:
 *
 *     A simple register device, which retains it's data. Reading will return
 *     the register's data, and writing to it will modify it.
 *
 * Supported cycles:
 *
 *      SLAVE, READ / WRITE
 *
 * Data organization:
 *
 *      Port size: 8, 16, 32 or 64 bit (module parameter: DATA_WIDTH)
 *      Port granularity: 8, 16, 32 or 64 bit (module parameter: GRANULE)
 *      Port maximum operand size: depends on port size
 *      Transfer ordering: Big endian
 *      Transfer sequencing: Undefined
 *
 * Wishbone specification used: B4 (https://cdn.opencores.org/downloads/wbspec_b4.pdf)
